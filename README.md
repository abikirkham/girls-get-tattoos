## About

This is my e-commerce platform built using Django where customers can purchase custom or pre-designed tattoos and consultations. It integrates Stripe for secure payments, provides user authentication, and enables booking consultation appointments through a calendar system. Users can view previous orders, save favorite tattoo designs, and manage their bookings and store owners have the control over product and consultation management.

## Future Development  

### Tech Support Chat  
A chat support feature is planned to provide customers with the highest standard of service.  

As the application already uses ASGI instead of WSGI, implementing chat support in the future will be more straightforward with Django Channels and Redis channel layers.  

### Third-Party Registration  
Facebook and Twitter were not considered for future development at this stage due to their additional business requirements. Google, being the most popular third-party registration service and relatively easy to implement, was prioritised. However, it is not accessible in all countries and regions, such as China.  

### Payment System  
The integration of PayPal as a payment option is planned for the future, as it is a preferred choice for many customers. Additionally, Alipay and WeChat Pay functionality are being considered for inclusion alongside the existing Stripe payment system, as these options are widely used in Asian countries, including China and Thailand.  

### Order Cancellation  
Further research and analysis are required for the order cancellation feature, which is why it has not been implemented at this stage.  

### Elastic Search  
Elastic Search is recognised as an essential feature for future development, as it has the potential to significantly enhance search speed and improve the quality of search results.  

### Deferred Features  
The decision to defer certain features was made thoughtfully. As a developer, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each feature, estimate the time required for their development, and plan their implementation accordingly.  

Understanding the exact operational procedures of a real business is crucial. For instance, insights into product prioritisation will play a vital role in setting up recommendation functionality. Therefore, some features have been intentionally left as opportunities for future learning and development.

## Design Philosophy
The website embraces a minimalistic, black-and-white theme to echo the artistic nature of tattoos and ensure the designs remain the primary focus. By stripping away all distractions, this monochrome palette provides a clean, timeless aesthetic that enhances the browsing experience for both customers and tattoo enthusiasts.

<img src="READMEmedia/home.png">

### Colour Scheme
The site exclusively uses black and white as the foundational colours:

- **Background:** White (`#FFFFFF`) to create a clean and spacious environment.
- **Text and Elements:** Black (`#000000`) for strong contrast and optimal readability.
- **Interactive Elements (e.g., buttons, hover states):** Subtle gradients or bold black borders to differentiate interactions without straying from the monochrome theme.

<img src="READMEmedia/product_detail.png">

This stark contrast ensures that every tattoo design and visual element stands out while maintaining an understated, professional look.

## Typography
The website uses the font **Montserrat**, chosen for its modern and versatile aesthetic, which aligns with the bold and creative energy of tattoo art. Montserrat ensures legibility and elegance across all devices and screen sizes.

- **Headings:** Font-weight set to **900**, emphasising key information such as "New Designs Are Here." This bold choice commands attention and reflects the strength and permanence of tattoos.
- **Body Text:** Font-weight set to **400**, providing a clean, smooth reading experience without overwhelming the viewer.
- **Buttons and Calls to Action:** Font-weight set to **700**, striking a balance between emphasis and consistency, encouraging user engagement.

## Imagery

- All imagery was sticking to my professional development in grapic design, all drawn by myself.

<img src="READMEmedia/luckycherry.png" alt="imagery of black and white product" width="200"><img src="READMEmedia/flower-bug.png" alt="imagery of black and white product" width="200">

The result is a bold and refined aesthetic that ensures a seamless and impactful user experience, perfectly complementing the artistic nature of tattoo designs.

---

## Wireframes

I have designed multiple wireframes to visually represent the layout and functionality of the application. These wireframes were created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) , a versatile and user-friendly design tool.

You can view the wireframes through the following link:

  [GGT Wireframes](READMEmedia/wireframe-profile-phone-merged.pdf)

These wireframes provide a detailed overview of the interface design, ensuring that the structure and user experience align with the projectâ€™s goals. They serve as a foundational step in the development process, helping to guide further discussions and decisions.

---

## Agile Methodology

<img src="READMEmedia/agile-methodology.png">

### GitHub Project Management
GitHub Project Management was used to manage the project. Without GitHub Project Management, it would have been difficult to effectively oversee the development of the application. It provided the tools necessary to:

- Prioritise tasks  
- Track progress  
- Ensure a structured workflow  

This methodology ensured the project stayed on track and that all aspects of development were properly managed.

---

## Flowchats

To understand some concepts, I created a couple flowchart diagrams.

1. The purchasing flow chart will show what steps are required to successfully complete a purchase.

<img src="READMEmedia/purchasing-flowchart.png">

2. The consultation flow chart wil show what a user needs to do in order to book a consultation.

### Like Feature

Allows users to like/unlike products. Liked products are shown on a dedicated page.

#### How It Works

- `Like` model links a user to a liked product.
- AJAX requests (secured with CSRF) toggle likes.
- Liked items are dynamically updated on the frontend.
- A list of liked items is shown via `liked_items_view`.

#### Model

```python
class Like(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    liked_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user} likes {self.product.name}"

```

Views

like_view: Toggles like/unlike via AJAX.
liked_items_view: Displays liked products for the user.
Template: liked_items.html

Loops through liked items and links to product detail pages.

### JavaScript (AJAX Example)

```javascript
        $(document).on('click', '.likeButton', function() {
            const button = $(this);
            const productId = button.data('post-id');
            const url = button.data('url');
            const csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content');

            $.ajax({
                url: url,
                type: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken
                },
                data: {
                    'product_id': productId
                },
                success: function(response) {
                    alert('Product liked successfully!');

## Google Calendar Integration Setup

This section explains how Google Calendar is integrated into the project and how users can use it to book consultations.

### Overview
Users can visit the consultations page to book a 30-minute video chat session to discuss graphic designs for their tattoo designs. This functionality is powered by Google Calendar API and ensures seamless scheduling.

### Integration Setup
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=. ...
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=consultations/config/calendar.json
     GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=girls-get-tattoos
     GOOGLE_AUTH_URI=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
     GOOGLE_TOKEN_URI=https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
     GOOGLE_AUTH_PROVIDER_CERT_URL=https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= ...
     GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://girls-get-tattoos-6ad59281377a.herokuapp.com/oauth2callback
     ```

2. **Google Cloud Console Configuration**:
   - In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), ensure the following:
     - OAuth 2.0 credentials are set up.
     - The redirect URI matches: `https://girls-get-tattoos-6ad59281377a.herokuapp.com/oauth2callback`.
     - Scopes include `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.

3. **Calendar JSON Configuration**:
   - Update `consultations/config/calendar.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "web": {
         "client_id": "client_id_here",
         "project_id": "girls-get-tattoos",
         "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
         "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
         "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
         "client_secret": "secret_key_here",
         "redirect_uris": [
           "https://girls-get-tattoos-6ad59281377a.herokuapp.com/oauth2callback"
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Install the following libraries in your `requirements.txt`:
     ```plaintext
     google-auth==2.17.0
     google-auth-oauthlib==1.0.0
     google-api-python-client==2.70.0
     ```

5. **Session Storage**:
   - Ensure credentials are securely stored in Heroku database. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in env.py.

6. **Django Views and URLs**:
   - Users access the consultations page (`/consultations`) to:
     - Authenticate via Google.
     - Book a session via Google Calendar.
   - The key views and URLs are defined in `consultations/views.py` and `consultations/urls.py`.

### User Workflow
1. **Access**:
   - Users navigate to the `/consultations` page.

2. **Login**:
   - If users are not authenticated with Google, they are redirected to log in.

3. **Booking**:
   - Once logged in, users can book a 30-minute session, which is added to their Google Calendar.

4. **Confirmation**:
   - A confirmation message is displayed, and the event is saved in both the userâ€™s and your Google Calendar.

### Error Handling and Security
- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensure proper validation for tokens, state parameters, and session expiration.
- **Security**:
  - Use encrypted storage for sensitive credentials.
  - Never expose sensitive data in version control.

By following these steps, users can easily book video chat sessions through Google Calendar, streamlining the consultation process for tattoo design discussions.
